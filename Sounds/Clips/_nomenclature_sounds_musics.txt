Here is a proposition of nomenclature for your music files:


snd_mus_target[_nameNamevar][_loop][_00][_a]


The target would be the part of the game where the music would be used. 
This is useful when it plays in a specific situation such as a boss fight theme, or a zone, or an event incoming...


Examples:
> snd_mus_bossFight_intro
> snd_mus_bossFight_phase3_loop
> snd_mus_bg_forest_enchantedSpring_loop_a
