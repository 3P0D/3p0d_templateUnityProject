Here is a proposition of nomenclature for your voice over files:


snd_vc_talkerCategory_talkerName[_context]_event[_lang][_var][_a][_0000]


The numbers here is the order of the line if multiple ones has to be played one after the other in a dialog voice over. 
The letter here would be more like a variations of different possible voices, like if you had 5 different greetings for a npc.
If no dialog sequence is required, just ignore those numbers
No need of context if the voice is emitted in generic context

Examples:
> snd_vc_npc_humanArchmage_greetings_en_a
> snd_vc_enemy_orcWarlock_defeated_whisper
> snd_vc_boss_dragonKing_quest026_encounter_fr_0006
