Here is a proposition of nomenclature for your FX sounds:


snd_sfx_target_nameName_var_00_a_action


About the action, you would like to have a very meaningful and recognizable name as it will help find it quickly in the project, just like the animations.


Examples:
> snd_sfx_boss_dragonKing_hurt_a
> snd_sfx_player_emote_yell_hurray
> snd_sfx_item_gold_isPickedUp
