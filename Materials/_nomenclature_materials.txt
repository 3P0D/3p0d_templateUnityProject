Here is a proposition of nomenclature for your materials:


mat_target[_nameName][_var][_00][_a]


The target should be about with what use that material. If it is binded to a specific mesh, multiple meshes, a terrain, etc... or on what part of a mesh it has to be used if there are multiple material channels on a single mesh.


Examples: 
> mat_player_body_wounded
> mat_enemy_orc_body_A
> mat_bg_humanCity_trees_autumn_01
