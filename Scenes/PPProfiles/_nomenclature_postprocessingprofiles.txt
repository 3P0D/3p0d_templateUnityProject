Here is a proposition of nomenclature for your post processing profiles:


ppp_sc_x[_nameName][_var][_00][_a]


The X is the number of your scene.
If the scene is a debug one, prefer this naming:
PPP_sc_x[_nameName][_var][_00][_a]_sceneOwner

The x has to stay there as this is a debug scene


Examples:
> sc_0_startMenu
> sc_1_game
> sc_x_debug_createPrefabs_3P0D
