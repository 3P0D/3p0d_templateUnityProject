Here is a proposition of nomenclature for your shaders:


shd_nameName[_var][_00][_a]


There are no specific things to tell about shaders, but do try to be as meaningful as possible in your names if you have multiples ones.
wSomething would be to specify some particular map/node needed/present in your shader.

Examples:
> shd_foliage_seasonSwap_wAlpha
> shd_standard_wSSS
> shd_fx_standard_bleeding
> shd_fx_dissolveBurn
